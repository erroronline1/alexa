amazon alexa skills. more or less useful

i do them in php for the easiest implementation on my webspace.
i have only one ssl certificate, therefore the unusual hostname and media-file-workarounds within the skills sourcecode.
playing with alexa once in a while i built a small libray (that might evolve in the future) to be able to concentrate on the specific tasks of the skill
feel free to share your opinion and improvements.

i forgot to say the skills are mostly in german language. not the sourcecode and variable names so i hope it to be still understandable.
